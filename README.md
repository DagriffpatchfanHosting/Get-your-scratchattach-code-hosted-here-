Welcome to the Use Text ML, Sync Cloud variables, host code, and more! GitHub Repository!

This repository is the central hub for all things related to our Scratch shop. Here, you can:

Host your Scratchattach code: If you have a Scratchattach project that follows the rules:
Only scratchattach scripts that need to run 24/7!
Don't ask me to run scripts really hard on computer resources - my pi isnt up for stuff like that
Don't use you password! For any scripts requiring authorization, use my username and set the password to ‘the_pw’. I will change it to my real password offline.
Don't perform social actions! This is not ok with the ST.
Don't include api keys or other sensitive info!
Don’t print anything because that will eat away at the RAM I have available.

Then create an issue in this repository. We'll review it and guide you through the hosting process.

Time to sync, maximum of 30 days so I'm not running scripts for no reason. If you want it to sync longer, come back every 30 days.
One way or two way (if you say one way I will sync the cloud variables of the second project to be the same as the cloud variables of the first one:
