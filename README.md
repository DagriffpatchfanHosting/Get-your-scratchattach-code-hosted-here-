Welcome to the Use Text ML, Sync Cloud variables, host code, and more! GitHub Repository!

This repository is the central hub for all things related to our Scratch shop. Here, you can:

Host your Scratchattach code: If you have a Scratchattach project that follows the rules:
Only scratchattach scripts that need to run 24/7!
Don't ask me to run scripts really hard on computer resources - my pi isnt up for stuff like that
Don't use you password! For any scripts requiring authorization, use my username and set the password to ‘the_pw’. I will change it to my real password offline.
Don't perform social actions! This is not ok with the ST.
Don't include api keys or other sensitive info!
Don’t print anything because that will eat away at the RAM I have available.

Then create an issue in this repository. We'll review it and guide you through the hosting process.

Sync Cloud variables between two projects!
Thanks to TimMcCool for creating  Scratchattach which powers this service and thanks to  Maximouse  for helping me with the script.
Fill out this form to get variables synced between projects:

The variables must have the same names! I can sync more that two projects, just post the links here as well.
Use - I need to know that I'm not going to break the community guidelines by doing this:
Time to sync, maximum of 30 days so I'm not running scripts for no reason. If you want it to sync longer, come back every 30 days.
One way or two way (if you say one way I will sync the cloud variables of the second project to be the same as the cloud variables of the first one:
First Project id:
Second Project id:
Do you own at least one of the projects:
Will you credit me and link this shop within the first 10 lines of the description(s):
Do you understand that the variables are not garunteed to sync:

First off, you will need to come up with your ML model. To do that, go to the very website I am using for the Python API (thanks to Dale for creating that awesome website!)  

**[Click here](https://machinelearningforkids.co.uk/)** and then click **Get Started**:

Once you have it perfected, come here to use it on Scratch!  

To use it on Scratch, remix this project: [Remix this project](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/1109502009/).  

Then fill out this form:  

Project link:

**CATEGORY**  
• Example 1  
• Example 2  
• Example 3  

(repeat for each category you have; there is a max of 500 examples total).
